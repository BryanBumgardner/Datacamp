# Datacamp Projects

A vast majority of the projects I'm doing on Datacamp seem pretty rudimental, which makes sense given it's a data science learning platform.

In this repository I will be improving the projects and making them better by improving the visuals, doing more analysis, whatever might spice them up.

This readme is of course a constant work in progress.

## A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones

Analyzing character connectivity within the Game of Thrones books using Network Analysis.

I am attempting to visualize the network a bit better. Right now it's hacked together with Bokeh and looks terrible, but the edge and node coloring characteristics of networkx and Bokeh don't play nicely.

Upcoming changes:
- Better graphs, one for each book
- integration of Plotly rather than Bokeh
- User-friendly cleanup of notebook

## Cryptocurrency Volatility

Exploring the volatility of the cryptocurrency market with graphs, specifically Bitcoin. In this project I fight with matplotlib graphs, my least favorite industry standard.

Upcoming changes:
- Integration of new data to make it cooler
- This one is basic. Tableau dashboard?
- User-friendly cleanup of notebook

## Dr. Semmelweis

This dude takes credit for hand washing in the western world, although I'm pretty sure Judaism had it figured out hundreds of years before he did. This contains some basic visualizations of his data.

Upcoming changes:
- combining all his data into one singular chart
- Recreation of the chart in Bokeh
- Flask application integration??

## Exploring Lego

This basic analysis is a simple exploration of Lego color and size data over the years.

It needs to be improved with lots of rigor, potentially new data.
